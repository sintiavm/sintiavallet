                     He likes to walk outdoors in good company, that is, with me. 
                     Aydar does not like to be ill. Since it is still quite cold in our area even 
                     in summer and often rains, he often has to watch the weather forecast so as not to be taken by surprise. 
                     Such a site is very useful to him.</h5>

                     Often travels to work in other cities. 
                     He does not have a car, so he must rely on public modes of transport. 
                     Knowing the weather in such cases is extremely important to determine what things to take on a business trip, 
                     whether to dress warmly, whether to bring an umbrella or sunscreen with you.</h5>
